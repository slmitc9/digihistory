# Women and Their Labor

## Introduction

Throughout the centuries women have been subjugated and exploited, their labor consistently devalued.  This was still very much the case at the dawn of the twentieth century.  Women were denied suffrage, largely contained to domestic work, and treated more like property than human beings.  In the history of the United States, women’s rights activists were largely maligned, even by similarly subjugated groups.  The first half of the century marked the beginning of a large societal change in regard to women’s autonomy and ability to choose (and vote) for themselves.  While they still faced an uphill battle, things like suffrage, the ability to enter the workforce, or participate in politics, meant that women had more opportunities than ever before in the United States.  In this paper we will explore how changing attitudes and important historical events intertwined to create a society that was on the trend towards gender equality, which is necessary in order for our society to continue to progress.  Without gender equality for women of all colors and all walks of life, our country simply cannot claim it is truly free, something most white, male Americans take for granted.  

## Suffrage

At the beginning of the twentieth century women were not allowed to vote.  While historically this had been the status quo for a long time, there was a growing
faction of society that was pressing for women’s suffrage.  While this movement consisted of mostly women, there were also men who believed in women’s right to suffrage and they did support and advocate for the movement.  Additionally, abolitionist and feminist movements tended to have a lot of overlap historically speaking, as they were seeking a similar level of equality. [^1]  While slavery was a travesty of epic proportions that had taken advantage of Africans and African Americans for a couple centuries in the United States, women were also held in a kind of domestic slavery for centuries as well and denied certain rights and liberties that were readily available to white men.  This gave abolitionists and women’s rights groups a level of common ground, leading them to support each other’s movements to some extent.  That being said, at the dawn of the twentieth century, African American men were granted 3/5 of a vote, while women were still barred from the polls completely. [^2]  Thus, the first major societal movement for women in this century began to ramp up dramatically.  Multiple groups such as the National Woman's Party (NWP), and the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) began to campaign in earnest for suffrage and they were not taking no for an answer, despite how many men wanted them to. [^3]  President Woodrow Wilson was one of these men.  The day before his inauguration as he got off the train, he was shocked to see no one was waiting for him as they were all at a women’s march a few blocks over. [^4]  Wilson, who would normally have described himself as shy was definitely not shy about his disdain for women in politics, explicitly stating that he felt a “chilled, scandalized feeling that always comes over me when I see and hear women speak in public.” [^5]  With the disdain of the president clear, women’s groups were fighting an uphill political battle for suffrage from the beginning of the century.

After the outbreak of World War I, Wilson continued to avoid granting women suffrage, citing the need to focus on the war above all else.  Leaders of the NWP and
NWSA capitulated and agreed not to press the issue of suffrage until after the war was over, with the understanding that Wilson would be more willing to work with them
if they did this.  The fact that many states had individually begun to grant women suffrage was also a boon to their cause as they felt this acceptance lent their fight more credence, credence that the president, ultimately, could no longer ignore. [^6]  After the conclusion of the war, Wilson kept his promise and supported the ratification of the nineteenth amendment.  This was not without the significant effort that women like Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt poured into the cause, in some instances going on hunger strikes, marching excessively, and tirelessly working on political campaigns.  Here are just a few pictures that exemplify this arduous task.  Finally, in 1920 women were granted the right to vote.  This legislative decision came down to just one single vote, by Harry Thomas Burn, who after voting no twice, was, as poetically as it might sound, influenced by his own mother to vote yes. [^7]  The United States had existed for 150 years before it finally granted women the right to participate politically.

While being granted the right of suffrage was surely something worth celebrating, it is still difficult to come to terms with the fact that women had to fight so hard in order for that right to ultimately be granted by the men who were in power.  It was an unequal fight from the beginning, a fight fought for women, by women, but a fight that was decided by men.  Not to mention, it was a right that was only extended to white women.  It was a step in the right direction of gender equality, but that does not mean that it was a cure-all or that women had any more control than they did previously if they were not white.  Frustrating though that might be to hear, the accomplishments of women like Paul and Catt cannot be ignored as they accomplished what they could within the climate they were born into.   

## Labor
	
Women’s suffrage was far from the only inhibition that the female gender faced in the American sphere however, paid labor was also a significant handicap for
women looking to make their own way in the world.  Women worked primarily in the domestic sector for most of history, with a huge majority having never been employed
outside of the home. [^8]  Women were foremost homemakers and in charge of the production and care of children.  When they did work outside the home, which was not often, it was still usually within the domestic sphere such as childcare, sewing, or laundry.  The onset of World War I began to change this however, as thousands of men went off to fight, leaving a labor vacuum that needed to be filled as quickly as possible.  In 1910 only about twenty five percent of women held a job outside the home, this number increased during the first World War, but quickly dropped again after the war ended and the men returned home and demanded their jobs back, leaving women who had just gained the right to vote almost back where they started. [^9]  With the onset of the Great Depression, employment dropped drastically among all sectors of society and while a small recovery was made under Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), ultimately the boon to employment rates for both men and women was the second World War.  By 1945, there were eighteen million women in the workforce, many of them working for the defense industry. [^10]  Because of a combination of factors, i.e. their husbands being out of the country and making their own money and being in sole control of it for the first time in their lives, women experienced a higher level of autonomy and freedom in the United States than they had ever had before. 

{% include feature/image.html filename="women.jpg" alt="Advertisement" caption="Advertisement seeking women streetcar drivers" width="50" %}

However, just because women finally had the freedom to join the workforce and make a living on their own, did not mean they no longer faced blatant sexism.  While there are a thousand examples this, let us focus on one specific advertisement for women to be hired to drive a streetcar in a major city.  The language can be infuriating to read, but it is indicative of the overall climate that women found themselves searching for jobs in.  In the very first sentence it refers to women doing the “man-sized” job of driving (something clearly not suitable for a woman according to society) and within the rest of the advertisement alludes to “manpower.”  As if this sexist language was not enough, concerned citizens are quickly assured not to worry, that the male veterans they have also hired “are still carrying the major responsibility.” [^11].  So, while yes, women were able to seek jobs outside of the home, the overall language was still reprehensible and dehumanizing.  Their labor was not considered equal to a man’s labor in any way, right down to the wording on the advertisements that were seeking to hire them. 

At the close of the war, men returned and sought to take their jobs back.  Unions facilitated these demands, and a percentage of women did lose their employment,
however, many women kept their jobs and continued to make a living and work outside the home. [^12]  This afforded women opportunities that had never
been available for them before.  They could support themselves and their families without a man, allowing some women to choose not to marry or even to leave a partner
who had been abusive to them.  Obviously, this was not a panacea, but it was a stark improvement for women and their ability to make their own choices and live their own lives.

## Politics	
	
Finally, over the first half of the twentieth century, women were able to enter the political sphere and advocate not only for themselves, but for improvements
in society as whole.  Urban planning was a heavy focus as cities were unorganized and essentially cesspools of garbage, human waste, and disease. [^13] This was something that women could address without heavy male backlash as it was viewed as an extension of the domestic sphere they already operated within.
Additionally, women could run for office, and with the passage of their right to vote, they could vote for their fellow women (although this did not always happen, as
most women voted along the same party lines as their husbands).  The Roosevelts were instrumental in allowing women to participate in politics as Eleanor was incredibly active in the political sphere and FDR appointed the first woman to ever serve in a presidential cabinet, Frances Perkins. [^14]  Perkins was instrumental during the New Deal and the helped author the Social Security Act, as she had the practical knowledge and experience to turn FDR’s vague dreams into a
concrete reality.  Perkins served for more than twelve years as the Secretary of Labor and accomplished a myriad of things that women would have never even been given
the opportunity to decades or ever years before. [^15]  Like many women throughout history who dared to step outside their socially accepted bounds, she faced her fair share of criticism and harassment, once even braving tomatoes and eggs being thrown at her during a speech.  Despite this, she carried on as if nothing had happened, stating after it was over “that’s politics.” [^16]  Because of her bravery, and the bravery of so many women like her, politics slowly became more acceptable for women to participate in.  This shift was also due to a few key men who respected women enough to allow them in the political arena in the first place. While there was still much progress to be made, it was undoubtedly a historical moment for gender equality. 

## Twentieth Century

The first half of the twentieth century was a turning point for women’s rights.  They gained the right to suffrage, after many decades of campaigning, protests, and even jail time.  They were allowed to work outside the home in greater numbers than ever before, allowing them an independence they have never known before, and they were finally allowed into the political sphere in a way that they never had been before.  While there was still much progress to be made, had these important events not taken place women would still be subjugated, we owe these brave women of the early twentieth century more than we know. 

The second half of the twentieth century saw further societal changes regarding women’s rights.  Women fought for equal rights within the workplace, rights to access birth control and health services on their own terms, and rights related to practicing their sexuality the way they wanted to without repercussions related to homophobia.  All of these rights (and the rights discussed in the first half of this essay) were centered around a certain amount of intersectionality relating to race, gender, and sexuality.  To dive into a full analysis of these types of intersectionality would require this paper to be much longer than the page or time limit allows, but it would be ideal for the reader to keep issues regarding this intersectionality in mind throughout these following paragraphs.  

## Second Wave of Feminism

Historically speaking, women’s labor throughout the twentieth century was never considered equal to that of a man’s labor and this disparity became increasingly clear in regard to pay differences between men and women who were working the same jobs with the same responsibilities.  On average women only made about 59 percent of what a man might make at the same workplace despite no difference in title or job description. [^17]  In the 1960’s and 70’s women began to protest these differences and a host of other inequalities, commonly known as the women’s liberation movement and regarded as the second wave of feminism in the United States. [^18]  Betty Friedan was one of the women who spearheaded this movement and the National Organization for Women, known as NOW (Gilmore and Sugrue).  Friedan and many of the women fighting alongside her simply wanted to be treated as equals in the workplace, a workplace that in the beginning of the century was not even available to them.  Despite the progress that had been made by the women that came before them, they knew the fight was not over.  A quote from Friedan sums up their attitude perfectly, asking lawmakers and politicians “to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, assuming all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.” [^19]

Equal rights for women participating in paid labor was far from the only fight, however.  During the second wave of feminism, women were also fighting for the rights to control their own bodies.  In many states marital rape was legal and access to birth control was highly restricted. [^20]  While the issue of consent in regard to sexual relations with their own husbands was highly damaging for many women, whether they were in an abusive marriage or not, the issue of marital rape and inability to access birth control is a much deeper problem than it first might appear to be.  This left women with very few options when it came to pregnancy and childbirth, forcing women to bring children into the world despite the fact that they might not want to do so, or might not be able to financially or emotionally care for them.  Women like Friedan fought not only for equal rights in the workforce, but also for their reproductive rights.  There was a nationwide push for cities and towns to create spaces for women to access birth control without needing permission from a man, but also for the creation of domestic violence shelters and women’s shelters so that women could escape from abusive situations (sometimes with their children) and still receive the support they needed. [^21]  This was especially important in a society that did not even allow women to build their own credit until almost the 1980’s. [^22]  Spaces that were made for women, by women, allowed them a greater sense of autonomy and gave women avenues of opportunity and support the likes of which had never before been seen in the United States.
