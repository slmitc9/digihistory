# Women and Their Labor in the Twentieth Century of the United States

Welcome to my website! Here you will find my essay for University of Idaho's history 320 class in the Spring of 2022.  My essay focuses on the intersection of gender and labor in the twentieth century United States.  Labor for women could be paid or unpaid, domestic or in the workplace.  This labor motivated women to fight for suffrage, seek to enter the job market outside of their homes, and attempt to enter the political sphere.  Hope you enjoy!
